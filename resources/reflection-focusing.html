                  <p>Learn Zen Reflection and Focussing for Inner Releasing & Inner Freedom. This is taught as part of our Radiant Heart, Radiant Mind Practice: Meditative Releasing of Inner Knots, Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight.</p>

            <p>Zen Reflection and Focussing training help one start to get clear of inner “felt” turbulence, contractions and old seeming barriers. It also improve ones mind-body connection and strengthens ones capacity to inwardly harmonize and bring presence to any area in the body that needs unbinding. By practicing Zen Reflection in a safe, supportive environment, we are helping ourselves and others in a very practical way.<br><br>

            People that attend this class will also learn the 6 easy-to-master Focussing steps of Dr. Eugene Gendlin, that identify and change the way thoughts and emotions are held within the body.**  Once learnes, these steps can be done virtually anywhere, at any time, and an entire session can be as short as 10 minutes. Its affects can be felt immediately - in the relief of bodily tension and psychological stress, as well as dramatic shifts in understanding and insight.<br><br>

            The Book and DVD shared in our library on Focusing shows additional ways to tap into greater self awareness and inner wisdom. (Focusing is technique based on the ground breaking research conducted at the University of Chicago).<br><br>

            As you learn to develop your natural ability to use the technique, you will find yourself becoming more in sync with both body and mind, filled with greater self assurance and better equipped to make positive changes to improve and enhance every aspect of your life.<br><br></p>
