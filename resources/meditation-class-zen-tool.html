              <p>Zen Life Practice Q & A class addresses how to deal with the grip of insecurities like not feeling good enough. How to “let go” and become more compassionate towards all beings including ‘seemingly’ unforgivable parts in ourselves. These practical mindfulness teachings help liberate your True-Self from the conditioned "little" self with its unconscious, self-limiting beliefs. </p>

              <p>You Will Also Learn the Root Practice and deeper aspects of Zazen Here.</p>

              <p>While there is now an extensive body of research that regular meditation practice will reliably create significant stress relief and many other health benefits, the real benefits are far beyond this (as you can will come to find out).</p>

              <p>The practice of Zazen Meditation is extremely simple and straight forward: One of the keys to Zazen is mastering not getting caught up in, entangling with, assessing, comparing, or trying to change what is mentally unfolding in the NOW. Zazen increase the Power to stay present (in the Now).</p>

              <p>Through Zazen, insight arises. Zazen is not about imposing calmness, stillness, or any special state of mind. It simply involves being aware moment by moment which sets the ground from which calmness and peace of mind eventually develop as natural side-effects. Initially this approach can seem similar to "mindfulness", except that with Zazen there is ultimately no object of awareness.</p>

              <p>Why attend with regularity?</p>

              <p>Zazen relies on regularity, habit and at the beginning - feedback and support. It certainly is no performance, contest, or forced activity. To sit Zazen is really as simple as choosing to do so. If you choose to do so, there is no question that you will be capable of it. So the real issue is not whether or not you will "succeed", but whether or not you may be willing to start.</p>

              <p>Just sitting is to be one with your present experience. Being one with your present experience is to become one with yourself - to re-harmonize body and mind and unentangle as we go deeper in our meditation. The practice is truly life changing and unbinding on many levels.</p>
