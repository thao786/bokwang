            <p>"Focusing is a beautiful and meditative approach to psychotherapy and personal growth. It offers a deep parallel to the practice of mindfulness in a carefully developed and sensitive way." <br>
              <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- Jack Kornfield Ph.D., Author of A Path With Heart -</span><br><br>

            "Focusing is a therapeutic application of Mindfulness and is a life path for healing and spiritual transformation." <br>
            <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- Tara Brach Ph.D,  Author of Radical Acceptance -</span><br><br>

            There are curious similarities in how Focusing and Buddhism approach the human condition. Each invites us to attend to our experiencing. Each emphasizes the importance of trusting and learning from our own experience, rather than relying on external authority to tell us what is true. Each attempts to reduce anguish and anxiety, and move us toward greater happiness and well-being.   The language of Buddhism is existential, it deals with life as we experience it. This is compatible with the language of Focusing, which also invites us to listen closely within. Both Focusing and Buddhism offer ways to train our attention so that we remain present with the experience as it unfolds. Both may be viewed as a method of open-ended inquiry into the nature of human experience. <br><br>

            "The principle is always to discover ourselves." <br>
            <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- From the Dzogchen teachings of Zen Master Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche -</span><br><br>

            “Both Focusing and meditation lead to a growing sense of openness to life. Focusing is much more than a method of dealing with life issues. It can lead to a way of life where we live more and more in our felt sense. Developing the "habit of felt-sensing," a term used by Peter Campbell and Ed McMahon, allows us to be with our experience with less clinging and attachment to any particular outcome. Meditation also helps us loosen our attachments so that we may be with experience unfolding. Our human tendency is to cling to what is pleasant and avoid what is unpleasant. According to the Buddhist view, the fact of suffering (First Noble Truth) is created by this clinging and grasping (Second Noble Truth). But there is a way out of this predicament (Third Noble Truth), which leads towards freedom, peace, compassion, acceptance, and gratitude.”<br><br>

            "Without awareness of our sensations, we are not fully alive. Life is unsatisfactory for most people because they are absent for their experience much of the time."<br>
            <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- Charlotte Joko Beck, Nothing Special : Living Zen -</span><br><br>

            “Focusing and meditation offer pathways toward release from suffering by attending closely to our inner world. They both encourage being present with how things actually are. Presence means having an intimate connection with what is living inside us. By learning how to stay present with experience as it is, we find a greater sense of freedom, aliveness, and open space. Being with what is real within us also connects us with others in authentic community.”<br><br>

            "Zazen is the practice of becoming intimate with oneself." <br>
            <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- Taisen Deshimaro -</span><br><br>

            “Familiarity with Focusing may refresh and deepen our understanding of Buddhist thought and vice versa. Focusing has a gentle method for approaching Buddhist notions such as emptiness and non-attachment. We tend to have many attachments or identifications that block us from experiencing peace and freedom. For example, we may cling to a self-image, shame, the inner critic, and to a self-consciousness that is separate from the life outside of ourselves. Loosening these attachments moves us beyond our limited sense of identity.<br><br>

            This direction may also deepen our understanding of "presence" being in direct, gentle relationship with what is. Focusing has a loving way of showing concretely how to step back and disidentify from emotional intensity, habit, and compulsion -- all the while developing greater intimacy with ourselves through presence in the deeply felt currents of our lives.<br><br>

            "As we increase our tolerance for not knowing, ambiguity, and emptiness, we connect more intimately with our true nature, other people, and life itself. We become more present to life.” <br>
            <span class="text-muted small" style="float:right">- Focusing, Feelings, and Sangha (Community) -</span><br><br>

            By practicing Focusing with ourselves and engaging in Focusing partnerships, we are building the sangha (community) in a very practical way.<br><br>

            Focusing can help meditators to welcome their feelings, needs, and wants. Learning to live more in our bodies and less in our ideas of how things should be, we connect more with what is authentic within us and between us. Opening more to the immediacy of felt experience, we enter a place within ourselves that simultaneously connects us with others who are also connecting with their authentic experience. This opens up fluid and creative possibilities for deeper love and connections in an non-authoritarian climate.<br><br>

            By sharing Zen Reflection and Focussing we build a creative foundation for intimate relationships in our Sangha Community. This courageous opening of our hearts can nurture our connections with others building a vibrant sense of community.  There is a story about Buddha's companion, Ananda, commenting that good friends and good companions is one half of the spiritual life. Buddha responded, 'Not so, Ananda! Not so! This is the whole of the spiritual life."</p>
