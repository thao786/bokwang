              <p>World Peace & Healing Prayers

We are all flowers in the Great Spirit's garden.  
We share a common root, and the root is Mother Earth.       
- Hopi Prophecy

A Buddhist Prayer for Peace

May all beings everywhere plagued with sufferings of body and mind quickly be freed from their illnesses. 
May those frightened cease to be afraid, and may those bound be free. 
May the powerless find power and may people think of befriending one another.  May those who find themselves in trackless, fearful wildernesses - the children, the aged, the unprotected - be guarded by beneficent celestials, and may they swiftly attain Awakening.. 
 - U.N. Day of Prayer for World Peace

Earth Prayer

We gently caress you, the Earth, our planet and our home. 
Our vision has brought us closer to you, making us aware of the harm we have done to the life-network upon which we ourselves depend. 
We are reminded that we have poisoned your waters, your lands, your air.  
We have filled you with the bones of our dead from war and greed.  
Your pain is our pain. 
Touching you gently, we pray that we may become peace-bringers and life-bringers so that our home in its journey around the Sun not become a sterile and lonely place.  
May this prayer and its power last forever.   
 - Sensei Ulrich, Manitoba Buddhist Temple

 - Native American Proverb

Treat the earth well.  We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.

Sunset. Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.
And I say the sacred hoop of my people was one of the many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy... But anywhere is the center of the world.
 - Black Elk

Water flows over these hands.
May I use them skillfully
to preserve our precious planet.

Navajo Chant

The mountains, I become a part of it…
The herbs, the fir tree, I become a part of it.
The morning mists, the clouds, the gathering waters,
I become a part of it.
The wilderness, the dew drops, the pollen…
I become a part of it.
 - Navajo Chant

Sioux Prayer

Grandfather Great Spirit
All over the world the faces of living ones are alike.
With tenderness they have come up out of the ground
Look upon your children that they may face the winds
And walk the good road to the Day of Quiet.
Grandfather Great Spririt
Fill us with the Light.
Give us the strength to understand, and the eyes to see.
Teach us to walk the soft Earth as relatives to all that live.
 - Sioux Prayer

Kindness To The Earth

Be aware of the contact between your feet and the Earth. Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet. We have caused a lot of damage to the Earth. Now it is time for us to take good care of her. We bring our peace and calm to the surface of the Earth and share the lesson of love. We walk in that spirit.
 - Thich Nhat Hanh

A Buddhist Prayer

May all beings everywhere be happy, peaceful, and free.

Evoking the presence of great compassion, let us fill our hearts with our own compassion – towards ourselves and towards all living beings.
Let us pray that all living beings realize that they are all brothers and sisters, all nourished from the same source of life. 
 - Buddhist Prayer

Bodhisattva Prayer for Humanity

May I be a guard for those who need protection
A guide for those on the path
A boat, a raft, a bridge for those who wish to cross the flood
May I be a lamp in the darkness
A resting place for the weary
A healing medicine for all who are sick
A vase of plenty, a tree of miracles
And for the boundless multitudes of living beings
May I bring sustenance and awakening
Enduring like the earth and sky
Until all beings are freed from sorrow
And all are awakened.
 - Shantideva, Indian Buddhist sage 700 A.D.  Prayer performed each morning by His Holiness the Dalai Lama

Prayer of Lovingkindness

May all beings be safe.
May all beings awaken to 
the light of their true nature.
May all beings be free.
 - Metta Prayer

Being Peace

If we are peaceful.
If we are happy.
We can smile and blossom
Like a flower.
And everyone
In our family,
Our entire society
Will benefit
From our peace.
 - Thich Nhat Hanh

Sky is Free

Sky is free.
Ocean is blissful.
Trees are divine.
Rocks are enlightened.
So are we.
Who is still searching ...
for what?
 - Anam Thubten Rinpoche

Enlightenment

Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. 
The moon does not get wet, nor is the water broken. 
Although its light is wide and great, 
The moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. 
The whole moon and the entire sky 
Are reflected in one dewdrop on the grass. 
 - Dogen

Quotes and Inspirations

All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.
 - The Buddha

In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.
 - From The Great Law of The Iroquois Confederacy

Display a heart of boundless love for all the world.
 - The Buddha

Without inner peace, outer peace is impossible.  We all wish for world peace, but world peace will never be achieved unless we first establish peace within our own mind.
 - Geshe Kelsang Gyatso

The dedication of a virtuous act for all beings is like a adding a drop of water to the ocean.  As long as the ocean exists, the drop of water exists.  So, too, a small positive action, when directed toward the benefit of all beings, will endure forever.
 - The Buddha 

I believe that to meet the challenge of our times, human beings will have to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility. We must all learn to work not just for our own self, family, or nation, but for the benefit of all humankind. Universal responsibility is the key to human survival. It is the best foundation for world peace, the equitable use of natural resources, and through concern for future generations, the proper care of the environment.
 - His Holiness the Dalai Lama

Buddhism emphasizes the impact our individual actions have on our lives and the world around us, and it follows from this perspective that caring for the natural world begins with each of us.
 - Gil Fronsdal, Vipassana teacher 

We are all flowers in the Great Spirit's garden.  We share a common root, and the root is Mother Earth.       
 - Hopi Prophecy

You should entreat trees and rocks to preach the Dharma, and you should ask the rice fields and gardens for the truth.
 - Eihei Dogen

The color of the mountains is Buddha's body; the sound of running water is his great speech.
 - Dogen

Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change our world.
 - The Buddha

Student - How may I enter the Way?
Teacher - Do you hear the murmur of the mountain stream? There you may enter.
 - Zen Koan

Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future. Live the actual moment.
Only this moment is life.
 - Thich Nhat Hanh</p><br><br>
