<h3>A Buddhist Prayer for Peace</h3>
<p>May all beings everywhere plagued with sufferings of body and mind quickly be freed from their illnesses. <br>May those frightened cease to be afraid, and may those bound be free. <br>May the powerless find power and may people think of befriending one another. <br>May those who find themselves in trackless, fearful wildernesses - the children, the aged, the unprotected - be guarded by beneficent celestials, and may they swiftly attain Buddhahood.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;U.N. Day of Prayer for World Peace</p>

<br>


<h3>Earth Prayer</h3>
<p>We gently caress you, the Earth, our planet and our home. <br>Our vision has brought us closer to you, making us aware of the harm we have done to the life-network upon which we ourselves depend. <br>We are reminded that we have poisoned your waters, your lands, your air.&nbsp; <br>We have filled you with the bones of our dead from war and greed.&nbsp; <br>Your pain is our pain. <br>Touching you gently, we pray that we may become peace-bringers and life-bringers so that our home in its journey around the Sun not become a sterile and lonely place.&nbsp; <br>May this prayer and its power last forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Sensei Ulrich,&nbsp;Manitoba Buddhist Temple </p>

<h3>Native American Proverb</h3>
<p>Treat the earth well.  We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.<br>
Sunset. Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.<br>
And I say the sacred hoop of my people was one of the many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy... But anywhere is the center of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Black Elk </p>

<h3>Quotes and Inspirations</h3>
<p>May all beings everywhere be happy, peaceful, and free.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Buddha</p>
<p>Display a heart of boundless love for all the world.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Buddha</p>
<p>All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Buddha</p>
<p>Without inner peace, outer peace is impossible.&nbsp; We all wish for world peace, but world peace will never be achieved unless we first establish peace within our own mind.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso</p>
<p>The dedication of a virtuous act for all beings is like a adding a drop of water to the ocean.&nbsp; As long as the ocean exists, the drop of water exists.&nbsp; So, too, a small positive action, when directed toward the benefit of all beings, will endure forever.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Buddha&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that to meet the challenge of our times, human beings will have to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility. We must all learn to work not just for our own self, family, or nation, but for the benefit of all humankind. Universal responsibility is the key to human survival. It is the best foundation for world peace, the equitable use of natural resources, and through concern for future generations, the proper care of the environment.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;His Holiness&nbsp;the Dalai Lama</p>
<p>Buddhism emphasizes the impact our individual actions have on our lives and the world around us, and it follows from this perspective that caring for the natural world begins with each of us.<br>&nbsp;- Gil Fronsdal, Vipassana teacher <strong><font color="#719f32">4</font></strong></p>
<p>All are nothing but flowers<br>In a flowing universe.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Nakagawa Soen-Roshi</p>
<p>You should entreat trees and rocks to preach the Dharma, and you should ask the rice fields and gardens for the truth.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Eihei Dogen</p>
<p>My heart that was rapt away by the wild cherry blossoms - will it return to my body when they scatter?<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Kotomichi</p>
<p>The color of the mountains is Buddha's body; the sound of running water is his great speech.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Dogen</p>
<p>Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change our world.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Buddha</p>
<p>Student -&nbsp;How may I enter the Way?<br>Teacher&nbsp;-&nbsp;Do you hear the murmur of the mountain stream? <em>There</em> you may enter.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Zen Koan</p>
<p>Be aware of the contact between your feet and the Earth. Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet. We have caused a lot of damage to the Earth. Now it is time for us to take good care of her. We bring our peace and calm to the surface of the Earth and share the lesson of love. We walk in that spirit.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
<p>Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.&nbsp;Live the actual moment.<br>Only this moment is life.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
