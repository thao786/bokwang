<p>DONATIONS ARE APPRECIATED... Join a Zazen Meditation Circle!</p>

<p>‘Your Community Meditation Circle' is an opportunity to Open and release the collected contractions of the day. It’s a time to refresh and go deeper into the underlying ground of being with Zazen Meditation. In the beginning of each class you will be guided, step by step, to deeply relax through the body in a specific order that also supports the flow of Qi energy within your body. (Qi is the bioelectricity carried by your nervous system. Current physiological research has verified that these currents control your immune system, the regeneration of organ tissues, and the growth of muscle and bone).</p>

<p>Zazen Meditation focuses on the art of creating a deeper foundation of awareness in daily life. A foundation that naturally peels away layers of dis-ease, discontent, fear and anxiety and moves one back to the original, resilient state of well being in body and mind, confident, content and peaceful. This is a time for you. No matter how busy we get, it’s so important to take the time to harness the power of P.K. and meditation and connect with a deeper place of peace and oneness (undivided mind). To not lose our (S)elf in the world. Join this Zazen Meditation practice class. You will be made to feel completely at home...  Social time and tea is offered after class. We send you peace, joy and love.</p>

<p>Note: This is a Donation Only Class. For people in financial hardship please know that ‘Gratitude Passes’ are accepted for ‘Your Community Meditation Circle - Open to 'Well Being’ Night.  Thank You for your help and support!</p>
