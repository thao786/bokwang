<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Parts of the Pon Klie Zen Qi-Gong Class we modeled off of the Mind-Body Wellness Program taught at the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. The mindfulness based stress reduction techniques come from Dr. Pingmae Park of Loyola Marymouss University. During the class, cares and troubles wash away. Replacing them are positive images, increased confidence and peace of mind. </p>

<p>Near the end of earn class the goal is for participants to attain the full 'relaxation response' and it's that response that helps release the feel good endorphins. Why is this important? Endorphins encourage white blood cells and white blood cells help the body fight infection and disease. According to Dr. Benson, "repeated activation of the relaxation response can reverse sustained problems in the body and mend the internal wear and tear brought on by stress." </p> 

<p>There are so many health benefits that come from practicing P.K. Zen Qi-Gong.  We currently offer classes and special 
training in Brampton, and Mississauga.</p>
   
<p>In addition to Qi-Gong, each class also includes aspects of yoga, tai-chi, energy work, stress reduction, meditation, core body exercises and deep breathing.   We invite you to experience the restorative health benefits of one of our classes for yourself.  For more information call 905-915-3017</p>

<p>According to recent research, Qigong was found to lower levels of cortisol, the damaging stress hormone, while simultaneously increasing immune system activity.  In another study, Qigong had fewer side effects than medical intervention in detoxifying heroin addicts and provided faster reduction in withdrawal symptoms with less anxiety.  Qigong was also found to reduce after-meal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. </p>

Zen Qi-Gong is a very effective form of holistic training for both mind and body and classes are offered at various locations (see Special Evets' on this site).

The Bask (Level-I) Pon Klie class Hae Kwang Robert teaches includes a blend of Yoga, Tai-Chi, Energy Work, Stress Reduction tedmiques, Meditation, Core Body Exercises and Deep Breathing - all in one 75 minute class. Classes start with easy stretching to warm up the body and open ben tines. At the same time, partidpants learn to regulate thought breathing and posture to help reduce the mind / body's neural activity. Repeated activation of the relaxation response can reverse sustained problems in the body and mend the internal wear and tear brought on by Ore.. It's near the end of each dass that the cerebral cortex enters a state of calm unknown in most people even during sleep. It turns off the fight or flight made of the nervous system, and switches on the parasympathetic brand, or the nervous systems healing mode. In this dass one also learns Pon Klie Breathing. Pon KIK Breathing not only cahns the mind and body, it also retrains a person to breath fully again from the abdomen. A newborn baby knows how to do this naturally. As we get older we loose this natural skill mainly because of stress. Fact: Your lungs are shrinking every day (.10 to 25% per decade (Framingham study) and by the time you're 50, you'll have lost between 35 to 40% of your breathing capacity People that don't metabolize stress well tend to be at the higher end in terms of lung shrinkage. This is becasue they tend to breath shallow and forget to breath when in the midst of conflict. Other studies show that by the time you reach the age of 70 you will have only about 55% of your lung capacity left. This is a problem that is both serious and AVOIDABLE!

<p>The benefits of P.K. Zen Qi-Gong are not just limited to physical health.  Over time, practitioners of P.K.  Zen Qi-Gong can start to experience a softening or alleviation of addictions / cravings.  Non-supportive thoughts, habits and emotions such as anxiety, anger, fear, guilt, despair, blame, apathy and grief start to fall away.  Replacing these are more supportive emotions such as equanimity, acceptance, love, peace and happiness.</p>
