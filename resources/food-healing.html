            <p>Thai herbal and food based healing have been taught and shared in Thai Buddhist Temples for hundreds of years. The form we teach comes from Wat Bua Luang Temple in the North of Thailand.  Similar to Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wat Bua Luangs ‘Thai Food Based Healing’ is a natural and holistic approach to health and well-being. Prior to new age medicine, the aspects of this medicinal practice was once taught by Thai Buddhist monks in the monasteries all over the country to promote well-being and to relieve a number of common and individual maladies.  Many of these ancient monastic healing traditions continue to this day in Thailand's most famous monasteries such as Wat Pho Buddhist Temple where Hae Kwang Sunim's Qi Gong Teacher taught.<br><br>

            This herbal and food based approach of course is not exclusive to Thai Buddhist Wats (Temples).  As Hae Kwang Sunim's Dharma father, Ven. Dr. Jongmae Park shared, “All monks learn this in Korea.  Natural healing is taught in all Korean Zen Temples.”  <br><br>

            This complimentary healing approach when combined with meditation, Pon Klie (Bad Stress Out) Zen Qi Gong, Hai Palung (Energy Healing) and Pon Klie Kwan Sow (Emotional Release), supports the whole person holistically - body, mind and spirit.<br><br>

            Upon returning to Canada, Hae Kwang Sunim has spent a great deal of time reviewing scientific journals and linking the Western supporting research and studies with these valuable eastern protocols that help build the body back up.  Although many of the remedies are well known throughout the East, it is only in the last decade that modern science has caught up with the wisdom behind the ancient ways to support the body back to health and wholeness.<br><br>

            <i class="text-danger">Mindfulness within our Practice is not just some technique but a total way of life. The ways of the world are concerned with creating results.

            <img src="%{l/image-host}/food-healing.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><hr>

            Jitanamai is the training and strengthening of the mind so that one will be able to focus and concentrate better by practicing mindfulness and meditation. The health benefits of daily practice are:<br>

            - Induce mental relaxation, inner peace and happiness<br>
            - Increase working efficiency owing to improved concentration<br>
            - Relieve stress, enhance the immune system and help to prevent psychosomatic disorders.<br><br>

            A well-trained mind would then lead to healthier habits, and good thoughts that help to guide a person to choose a healthful way of life and not easily give into negative mental habits and negative energies.<br><br>
