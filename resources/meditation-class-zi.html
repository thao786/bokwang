              <p>ZI 1: Introduction to Zen Practice covers Instruction on the basics of Zen sitting and walking practices, specifically focusing on postures of the body, breath, and mind. There is an opportunity for a practice session and questions and answers. All members who sit with us are encouraged to take this class at least once to learn proper form.  </p>

              <p>One must register 48 hours in advance on Meetup if wishing to take this class (or e-mail Hae Kwang Sunim directly of intentions to attend at lotus-zen@earthlink.net).</p>

              <p>Bo Kwang Meditation Center is part of one of the largest Zen orders in the world. We offer many programs through the week. The best place to start is ZI 1: Introduction for Zazen Practice to help learn the Zazen meditation steps and how to begin a meditation practice here.  This is a Donation Only Class.</p>

              <p>If you are new to Zen and Zazen Meditation please attend ZI 1 first before attending our meditation classes. </p> 

              <p>Note: Retreats and Qigong are also offered for a reasonable price. Zen meditation is a powerful way to bring peace back into our lives and to transcend habitual thinking. It helps us to balance ourselves and our world by pointing us towards our own wisdom and compassion. New friendships are formed and support for doing this practice is found by coming together for this special purpose.</p>

              <p>Newcomers are always welcome at Bo Kwang Meditation Centre. Some people come seeking answers to fundamental questions about life. Others are searching for peace of mind and relief from stress. With regular practice, Meditation, Zen and Qigong can help us all.</p>
