              <p>PK Mindfullness Training with Hae Kwang Robert Sunim</p>
              
              <p>By focusing our radiance inward with PKM we begin to discover the nature of mind and we learn to 'let go' more easily. Much of the content that bubbles up in the mind is actually repetitive and for some - quite judgmental, filled with expectations and not very supportive. When 'untrained', it can be a tyrant and lead to pain within us and to those around us and so quicldy scatter and dissipate our energy. When SIdllfully trained' however, it can support us in our daily life and help us to preserve our vital energy. PKM involves the practice of 'putting down' and bringing the mind back home. This is the first step in breaking down the walls of straggle and seeing the root-the inner voice in the head that we take to be who we are.</p>

              <p>Over time one becomes more skillful at putting down addictive thinking (and the identification to it) and is able to go deeper into stillness, rest the nervous system and move closer to who they really are at the depth of their being.</p>

              <p>Who Am I? In this series we dissect 'meditation and look at how Zen helps us to transcend our ego-based state of consciousness. Negative mind states like envy and resentment that bubble up in the mind are born from the ego. Understanding the practice and implementing it in our lives is a key not only for personal happiness and greater peace in our life but also for reducing the level of violent conflicts on our planet. If more people practiced this technique and understood their ultimate connection to all that is, the world would be at peace. As one great Zen Master said "World peace is Zen." Beyond identification with a per.nal 'tribal' history, who am I? Zen practice is about understanding yourself.</p>

              <p>NOTE Medical research has shown that meditation can be a significant part of a wellness program, lowering stress levels and blood pressure, promoting .rdiovascular and neurological health, enhancing alertness, boosting immune system function and overall well being. When we know our minds well and the emotions that our thinking creates  we are able to consciously dial down the adrenaline and tension in the body and increase endorphins, centeredness and cola. This meditation training blends well with other wellness programs, methods, and disciplines. It is fully compatible with and respectful of the world's great religious traditions. </p>
