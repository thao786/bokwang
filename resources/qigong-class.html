              <p>As acclaimed cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, vice-chair and professor of surgery at Columbia University and director of the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine Program at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital writes in his best selling book ‘Staying Young’: “Qi-Gong allows us to cope with the day to day struggle of being human – it can help us stretch and stay loose and balanced in both mind and body.” On the Ophra Winfrey show in November he simply put it this way, "If you want to be healthy and live to be 100, do Qi-Gong." He also added that Qi-gong reverses the aging process.</p>

              <p>Parts of P.K.Q.G. are modeled off of the Mind-Body Wellness Program taught at the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. The mindfulness based stress reduction meditation techniques come from Dr. Jongmae Park of Loyola Marymount University. During P.K.Q.G., cares and troubles wash away. Replacing them are positive images, increased confidence and peace of mind.</p>


              <p>Near the end of each class the goal is for participants to attain the full ‘relaxation response’ and it’s that response that helps release the feel good endorphins. Why is this important? Endorphins encourage white blood cells and white blood cells help the body fight infection and disease. According to Dr. Benson, “repeated activation of the relaxation response can reverse sustained problems in the body and mend the internal wear and tear brought on by stress.” (Ref: Center for Women’s Healthcare, Weil Medical College of Cornell University.)</p>
