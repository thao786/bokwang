3. Bob is sure Alice sent it because only she and him know the key and he didnt send it. Alice can deny it by saying Bob sent it to himself.

4. you can send the credit card M by encrypting it wt their public key then only them who has the private key can decrypt it.
For you to receive the confirmation number, you can pick a symmetric key first to send it along with M. The site can encrypt confirmation number wt this symmetric key before sending it to you.

5. authentication and non-repudiation: needs something ONLY Alice knows and unique to Alice.
	Alice encrypts msg wt her private key and send it to Bob. He decrypt by using her public key (no confidentiality)
	wt confidentiality: encrypt the above once more wt Bob's public key.

6. known ciphertext: list out frequencies of each character -> map the characters according to its natural frequencies in each languages.

7. known plain-text: we only need 2 different letters to crack Affine.
	c1 = ap1 + b mod 26
	c2 = ap2 + b mod 26
	-> a = (D-1)(p1 - p2) mod 26 
D-1 is the inverse of (c1 - c2) mod 26. This could be found by looping through 1-25.
	-> b = c1 - ap1

8. no, because multiple rounds of affine is as effective as 1.
