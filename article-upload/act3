3. we never use 1 cuz pt^1 mod phi equals pt, which is the same as not encrypted.
we dont use 2 cuz gcd(2,phi) is 2, not 1

4. no. we pick n1 or n2 to be prime so that it is guaranteed that we can find n2 from n1.

5. use fermat little theorem:
	x = k^2 = s^(n-1) mimd n
according to the theorem, if x isnt 1, n cant be prime

6. since modulus n is part of the public key n, eve knows the 2 sites use the same n. 
brute force all possible credit cards that satisfies:
ct1 = pt ^ e1 mod R
ct2 = pt ^ e2 mod R
