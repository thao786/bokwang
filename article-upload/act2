1. all we know is a mod 26 = 11

2. 

3. double affine is possible but not better than one affine.

4. a in {1 3 5 7 9 11 15 17 19 21 23 25}
5a + b = 11 mod 26
0a + b = 5 mod 26

a= 22, b=5;

5. Eve would see a 6 letter words repeated around a hundred times (plaintext's structure).


7. first, ~K will produce a set of subkeys that are all complements of subkeys generated by K.

look at round 1:
	E(R1) xor K1 = E(-R1) xor (-K1)
because  1 xor 1 = 0 xor 0; 1 xor 0 = 0 xor 1
this makes the result of the function f and permutations produce the same output since they start with the same input.

So, after round 1, if L1 and R1 produce L2 and R2 then -L1 and -R2 produce -L2 and -R2.

Continue 16 rounds, the results are still complements of each other. Same after permutations and concatention.

8. a key of all 1's would produce all subkeys of all 1's. so the list of subkeys to decrypt would look the same as ecnypt, making the second encryption as effective as decryption of the first one. hence a keys of all 1s would double any text into itself. (or any key that would produce the palindrome structure subkeys.)


9. yes. cuz the key space is only 2^112
